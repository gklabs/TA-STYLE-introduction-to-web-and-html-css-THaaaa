<h1>Hamming on new systems</h1>
<p>It is first necessary to prove beyond any doubt 
  the new thing, device, method, or whatever it is,
  can cope with heroic tasks before it can get into the
  system to do the more routine, and in the long run,
  more useful tasks. Any innovation is always against 
  such a barrier, so do not get discouraged when you find 
  your new idea is stoutly, and perhaps foolishly, resisted. 
  By realizing the magnitude of the actual task you can then
  decide if it is worth your efforts to continue, or
  if you should go do something else you can accomplish 
  and not fritter away your efforts needlessly against
  the forces of inertia and stupidity.
