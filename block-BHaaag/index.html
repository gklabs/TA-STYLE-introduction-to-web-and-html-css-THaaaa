  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
  <p>How quickly an employee would be deployed to a Business while on the Bench ? Organization level employee deployment data was extracted to build and maintain a predictive Machine Learning model. Used techniques like Random Forest, XGBoost (Bagging and Boosting) to ensemble, fine tune model predictability. The model was successfully deployed and I had got the opportunity to present it to the Stakeholder.

  <h3>Data scientist</h3>
  <p>
    Organization level employee specific data was extracted to build and maintain a predictive Machine Learning model that can accurately predict employee ratings in the organization. Applied Bagging and Boosting techniques to enhance model accuracy. The model was successfully deployed and used for dispute resolution, and to identify high performers.
  </p>

  <h3>Financial Analyst</h3>
  <p>
    Customer level data from the Vehicle loan business of the company was used build a Machine Learning model that could essentially monitor, identify variables that would reduce Non-Performing loans. Applied Logistic Regression and Random Forests to the problem. The model was successfully deployed and used to grade customers based on credit risk, and used as a pointer to identify potential loan defaulters and swift payers.
