  ### Create a page according to the design shown below.

  TODO:
    - Open this image in a window for the design layout - (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suraj122/AC-STYLE-images/master/introduction/assignment2.png)
    - Use external stylesheet to style the page.
    - For applying image use `<img src="" alt="">` tag. 
      Keep source of the image inside `src=""` attribute. 
      Put an alternative text of the image inside `alt=""` attribute. 
      You can can also apply width and height to the image by applying `width="" and height=""` attribute inside image tag. for example - `<img src="suraj.jpg" alt="suraj" width="200" height="200">`
    - For centering the element apply `text-align: center`, to the parent of the element in CSS.

  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
  How quickly an employee would be deployed to a Business while on the Bench ? Organization level employee deployment data was extracted to build and maintain a predictive Machine Learning model. Used techniques like Random Forest, XGBoost (Bagging and Boosting) to ensemble, fine tune model predictability. The model was successfully deployed and I had got the opportunity to present it to the Stakeholder.

  <h3>Data scientist</h3>
  Organization level employee specific data was extracted to build and maintain a predictive Machine Learning model that can accurately predict employee ratings in the organization. Applied Bagging and Boosting techniques to enhance model accuracy. The model was successfully deployed and used for dispute resolution, and to identify high performers.

  <h3>Financial Analyst</h3>
  Customer level data from the Vehicle loan business of the company was used build a Machine Learning model that could essentially monitor, identify variables that would reduce Non-Performing loans. Applied Logistic Regression and Random Forests to the problem. The model was successfully deployed and used to grade customers based on credit risk, and used as a pointer to identify potential loan defaulters and swift payers.
